I am a software engineer and intersted in games, both gaming and game developing. I finished my bachelor in 2018 and became a mobile game dev. Game developing is fun but rendering seems more intersting to me. I decided to continue my study in computer science in DTU to learn graphics. I did learned a lot in graphics there and finally I finished my master thesis about cloth rendering. "Graphics is awesome". I will continue my journey in graphics, and making a raytracer is the first step. Playing games is also important to gain inspiration to make games. Games I like the most are DarkSoul, BaldurGate, DarkestDungeon.
